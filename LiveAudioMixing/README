Phase one of our Live Audio mixing project:

Aim: given an audio signal classify as instrument(mridanga, violin) or vocals

training : dataset with audio sample for each ( in the repo only five sample for each is provided for conceptual understanding)

code: 

first extracts metadata and stores in csv : metadata includes folder it belongs to , url to the folder and class( 1 for mridanga 2 for violin and 3 for vocals
Once mtadata is extracted. Feauture extraction is run on each of the audio files: MFCC values are extracted using librosa package 
MFCC values are stored as 20 attributes along with the meta data in features extracted csv file
Finally a SVM model ( ML model for classification) is run training on MFCC values (20 attributes) and the output is the class as mentioned above
the model is saved for later use
Validation is done to test accuracy of model and rated based on metrics finally
